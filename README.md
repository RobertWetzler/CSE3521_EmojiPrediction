# CSE3521_EmojiPrediction
Emoji Prediction Project for CSE 3521

Zenhub: https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/cse-3521-emoji-project-603976069eeab10015951228/board?repos=330051337


HERE IS THE README FILE INCLUDED WITH THE PROJECT SUBMISSION: 

Below details each folder and its contents:

Algorithms(.ipynb File): 
	Contains the code for both algorithms. 
	The files are .ipynb files.

Algorithms(.py File): 
	Contains the code for both algorithms. 
	The files are .py files.
	Note: The .py files contain the same code as their .ipynb counterparts. 
	The .py files were provided in case there's difficulty in running the .ipynb code



Below provides the links to the Google collab code for each algorithm 
(the code is the same as in the .ipynb and .py files provided in the folders above)
Note that you won't be able to actually run the code using these links.

Below is the GitHub link. This is where all of the test and training data were stored, and you can also find a copy of the code for each algorithm (.py files) in the GitHub. 
You can also find a copy of the final report as a .docx file. 
Additionally, you'll find the file emoji_graph.py. This file was used to create the individual emoji accuracy graphs
